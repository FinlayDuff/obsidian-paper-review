This repo is designed for those who wish to use Obsidian for paper review, utilising the three-pass approach.

## Process
1. Save the PDF of the paper to Reading materials. *Tip: you can set the browser downloads folder to be this folder*
2. Create a new note using the three-pass template. *Tip: this can be initated with the template library hotkeys*
3. Reference the PDF with the Obsidian notation \[\[\<name of the paper\>\]\]

Your set, now you just have to read the paper and fill out the sections based on each approach!
